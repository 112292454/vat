      # 断句阶段的场景特定提示词
      split: |
        Scene: gaming livestream. Extra splitting preferences (break placement only).
        - Prefer shorter lines during action; allow denser <br> when reactions are rapid.
        - Split "event" vs "reaction": what happened first, emotion/comment next.
        - Keep game/UI terms intact: boss/stage/skill/item/quest/character names; abbreviations (HP/MP/FPS/Lv); number+unit.
        - Keep NAME + honorific together (Xさん/ちゃん/先輩) on the same line; do not split inside a term.
        - Short callouts can be standalone lines (right/left/behind/run/dodge/heal etc.) without rewriting.
        - Onomatopoeia/SFX: standalone only at peak moments; otherwise attach to the related action line.
        - Viewer thanks/callouts (@name / SC / superchat / ありがとう) should be standalone when possible.

      optimize: |
        Scene: gaming livestream. Extra optimization priorities (same language, minimal edits).
        - Prioritize fixing misrecognized game terms/UI labels/items/skills/names using local context.
        - Do NOT remove reaction tokens that carry meaning in gaming (e.g., えっ/うわ/やば/ナイス/ファイト); keep them but fix obvious ASR typos.
        - Keep numbers/units/abbreviations exactly; do not “normalize away” percentages, HP/MP, ranks, levels.
        - Keep repeated emotional bursts if they show hype, but compress extreme repeats to readable length.
        - Avoid over-correcting into formal prose; keep short, chatty, reactive style.

      translate: |
        Scene: gaming livestream. Extra translation preferences (Chinese output).
        - Pace-first: short, punchy Chinese; keep reactions strong but not “mainland influencer slang”.
        - Terms-first: keep community-standard game terms; keep HP/MP/FPS/Lv, numbers, keybind-like tokens.
        - Commands/callouts should stay short and readable (e.g., “右边/后面/快跑/躲/奶我”).
        - If a katakana word is clearly an item/skill/food/tool, translate it (do not romaji).
        - For unknown player/call names: keep NAME in romaji; translate honorifics (chan/senpai etc.) per global rules.
        - Keep “www” only for laughter (if your global rule allows it); do not use it for other sounds.


  - id: "chatting"
    name: "闲聊直播"
    description: "Casual conversation, Q&A session, daily life sharing, viewer interaction."
    keywords:
      - "chat"
      - "talk"
      - "雑談"
      - "freetalk"
      - "zatsudan"
    
    prompts:
      split: |
        Scene: casual chatting (雑談). Extra splitting preferences (break placement only).
        - Prefer fewer breaks; keep natural conversational chunks when within length limits.
        - Break at topic shifts, story beats, turn-taking, Q->A boundaries.
        - Do not isolate fillers unless emphatic; usually attach (えっと/あの/なんか/うーん etc.).
        - Greetings, direct address, viewer interaction/thanks should be their own line when possible.
        - If forced to split for length, split by clauses (because/so/but) rather than fragmenting phrases.

      optimize: |
        Scene: casual chatting. Extra optimization priorities (same language, minimal edits).
        - Remove only truly redundant fillers/repeats; keep natural hesitations that set a friendly tone.
        - Fix “valid word but wrong context” ASR errors using nearby lines; do not invent new facts.
        - Keep names/call-names consistent within the batch (same spelling/romaji choice).
        - Keep casual punctuation; do not rewrite into formal written style.

      translate: |
        Scene: casual chatting. Extra translation preferences (Chinese output).
        - Friend-to-friend tone: natural Chinese syntax, warm and light; avoid “宝子们/家人们/YYDS/绝绝子”等尴尬话术。
        - Viewer address: prefer neutral “大家/各位/你们”; thanks should sound sincere, not salesy.
        - Keep small pauses and soft interjections when they help rhythm (嗯——/诶——/那个…).
        - If a term looks like a practical meaning (food/tool/game item), translate it rather than romaji.
        - Unknown collab names: romaji for the NAME only; honorifics translated per global rules.


  - id: "asmr"
    name: "ASMR放松"
    description: "ASMR content with soft speaking, whispering, relaxation, sleep aid, trigger sounds."
    keywords:
      - "asmr"
      - "relax"
      - "sleep"

      - "耳かき"
      - "癒し"
    
    prompts:
      split: |
        Scene: ASMR/whisper/relaxation. Extra splitting preferences (break placement only).
        - Gentle rhythm: use short lines, but avoid choppy fragmentation of a single calm meaning unit.
        - Prefer breaks at action changes, trigger changes, or natural pauses.
        - Onomatopoeia/trigger sounds may be standalone or attached to the action line (do not rewrite).
        - Avoid single-character lines unless clearly intentional/emphatic.
        - Keep viewer interaction/thanks standalone when present, but compact.

      optimize: |
        Scene: ASMR/whisper. Extra optimization priorities (same language, minimal edits).
        - Do NOT aggressively delete “fillers”: many are intentional soft sounds in ASMR (breath, tiny hesitations).
        - Fix only clear ASR mistakes that break meaning; keep softness markers, elongated vowels, gentle repeats.
        - Preserve trigger/onomatopoeia tokens; compress only if they are unreadably long.
        - Avoid making text “loud”: no added exclamation, no strong punctuation changes.

      translate: |
        Scene: ASMR/whisper. Extra translation preferences (Chinese output).
        - Soft, calming Chinese; prefer “…” / gentle wording; avoid exclamation marks.
        - Keep short lines; do not over-connect sentences.
        - Translate trigger actions clearly (e.g., 耳かき -> 掏耳朵) when unambiguous.
        - Onomatopoeia: prefer readable Chinese sound words (“沙沙/轻轻/呼——”) over romaji; keep it minimal.
        - If a token is clearly a NAME, romaji is ok; otherwise translate for comprehension.


  - id: "singing"
    name: "歌回直播"

      - "カラオケ"
      - "utawaku"
    
    prompts:
      split: |
        Scene: singing/karaoke (歌枠). Extra splitting preferences (break placement only).
        - Separate "lyrics-like" parts vs spoken commentary by break density (lyrics often shorter lines).
        - Lyrics-like text: prefer rhythmic short lines (like lyric lines) without rewriting.
        - Keep song title/artist/work names intact; break before/after them if needed.
        - Spoken talk between songs: follow chatting-style chunking (avoid over-splitting).
        - Repeated syllables/interjections may be standalone if it matches rhythm.

      optimize: |
        Scene: singing/karaoke. Extra optimization priorities (same language, minimal edits).
        - Distinguish lyrics vs speech; do not “correct” lyrics into normal prose.
        - For lyrics, fix only obvious ASR garbage; preserve repetition and rhythm cues.
        - Keep song titles/artist names consistent (same spelling/romaji choice).
        - Avoid deleting elongated vowels or small adlibs if they are part of singing.

      translate: |
        Scene: singing/karaoke. Extra translation preferences (Chinese output).
        - Lyrics: translate lightly and concisely; keep line rhythm; avoid modern meme/slang; do not add commentary.
        - Spoken parts: use chatting-style natural Chinese.
        - Song title/artist: use official Chinese name if clearly known; otherwise keep as romaji (NAME only).
        - Keep musical terms (key/pitch/tempo) accurate and compact.


  - id: "teaching"
    name: "教学解说"
    description: "Tutorial, educational content, knowledge sharing, explanation streams."
    keywords:
      - "tutorial"
      - "how to"
      - "guide"
      - "explain"
      - "教学"
      - "講座"
    
    prompts:
      split: |
        Scene: tutorial/explanation. Extra splitting preferences (break placement only).
        - Break at step/discourse markers (まず/次に/最後/注意/要するに/例えば etc.).
        - Prefer “definition -> explanation -> conclusion” as separate lines when length requires.
        - Keep technical terms/abbreviations/variable-like tokens intact.
        - Keep code/commands/paths as a single unit; allow slight overflow rather than splitting inside.
        - Enumerations (A,B,C) can be separate lines if it improves readability.

      optimize: |
        Scene: tutorial/explanation. Extra optimization priorities (same language, minimal edits).
        - Prioritize correcting technical terms, numbers, commands, file paths, APIs using local context.
        - Do NOT “simplify away” symbols, operators, or formatting that matters (%, ->, ::, /path, flags).
        - Keep logical connectors (まず/次に/だから/つまり) unless they are clear ASR noise.
        - Avoid stylistic rewriting; keep meaning and structure close.

      translate: |
        Scene: tutorial/explanation. Extra translation preferences (Chinese output).
        - Clarity-first: structured, stepwise Chinese; slightly more formal is ok, but still subtitle-friendly.
        - Keep technical tokens unchanged (code/paths/flags); translate surrounding explanation.
        - Term consistency: use one Chinese rendering per term; if helpful and unambiguous, allow tiny parentheses (e.g., VRAM（显存）).
        - Avoid slang; keep precise wording; do not invent missing steps or facts.
